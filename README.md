# Steganographyio

Summer Project

A simple website to hide files within images, built using Web Workers and Subtle Crypto in vanilla JavaScript.

## 1. How It Works

#### 1.1. What Is Steganography?

Here's a short summary paraphrased from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography):

_Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating. The first recorded use of steganography can be traced back to 440 BC, but it continues to be an incredibly versatile and effective method for obscuring or hiding information in plain sight._

#### 1.2. Types of Steganography

There are many steganography techniques for hiding data, however with the aim of hiding files inside images, only two methods were viable:

- **Hiding the file data within the image data**, replacing unnecessary image data with the information we want to hide. This method usually works by hiding the data in the least significant bits of the colour component of images. The file size remains the same (as data is only replaced, not added) which means that the steganography is hard to spot, but only a very small amount of information can be hidden in each image.

- **Adding the file data alongside the image data**, which increases the total file size but retains the full image quality. By adding hidden data into an ignored section of a file, such as after the logical end of the image, any amount of information can be hidden. However, this method is easier to spot as the file size will increase and the file can be examined to show the extra information.

The second method was chosen as the focus for this project, with the view of the end user hiding any number of files in an image, irrespective of the resolution of that image.
